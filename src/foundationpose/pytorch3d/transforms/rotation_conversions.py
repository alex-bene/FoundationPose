"""
The transformation matrices returned from the functions in this file assume
the points on which the transformation will be applied are column vectors.
i.e. the R matrix is structured as

    R = [
            [Rxx, Rxy, Rxz],
            [Ryx, Ryy, Ryz],
            [Rzx, Rzy, Rzz],
        ]  # (3, 3)

This matrix can be applied to column vectors by post multiplication
by the points e.g.

    points = [[0], [1], [2]]  # (3 x 1) xyz coordinates of a point
    transformed_points = R * points

To apply the same matrix to points which are row vectors, the R matrix
can be transposed and pre multiplied by the points:

e.g.
    points = [[0, 1, 2]]  # (1 x 3) xyz coordinates of a point
    transformed_points = points * R.transpose(1, 0)
